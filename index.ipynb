    "In this lab we are going to practice creating a one to many relationship. We've learned how a belongs to relationship works -- with the \"belongs to\" class knowing the one instance it is associated with. Now, what if we think about it from the other side? Let's say we are talking about a `Person` class and a `Dog` class. We know the `Dog` belongs to one `Person`, but that doesn't mean the person can't have more than one dog, right?"
